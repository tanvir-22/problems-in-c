//Write a program to print all even numbers between m and n (m, n are user inputs) in reverse order.
Sample input/output (bold ones are inputs):
Enter m: 9
Enter n: 21
All even numbers between 9 and 20 in reverse order: 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int m,n,i;
    printf("enter m:");
    scanf("%d",&m);
     printf("enter n:");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=n;i>=m;i--){
        if(i%2==0)
            printf("%d\n",i);
    }
return 0;
