/*   2.	Write a C program to check whether an input number is a perfect number or not. 
A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive factors.
For e.g. 6 is a perfect number; 
because proper factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 1+2+3 = 6. 
Also, 28 is a perfect number since sum of its factors = 1+2+4+7+14 = 28.
